# The-Uplift-Project-AI
Repository built and maintained by The Uplift Project(GirlScript Organisation) AI Team 15 to add weekly updates.

## Plan

### June
*Week 1:* Project topic finalised
*Week 2:* Literature survey
*Week 3:* literature survey+dataset collection
*Week 4:* Datasets finalization from kaggle, UCI machine learning repository etc
### July
*Week 1:* EDA(exploratory data analysis)
*Week 2:* Pre-processing techniques studied and experimented
*Week 3:* Finalize preprocessing step using experiments in week 2, work on referring kaggle kernels or start experimenting on ML/DL algos/ architectures and why one architecture over another?
*Week 4:* Implementation of ML/DL algorithms for the same
### August
*Week 1:* Run multiple more experiments after obtaining results for July week 4 experiment with multiple tweaks in algorithms or training approaches/hyper params
*Week 2:* Compare all the experiments performed so far (which are simultaneously stored in weights and biases website for each experiment to track progress) and chose the best method. Answer questions such as why or how one particular method worked over another.
*Week 3:* Further experimentation/visualization of loss curves/precision recall trade-off/confusion matrix for indepth analysis of getting false positive, false negatives rate, finalize results and learnings
*Week 4:* Submit all analysis, learning, experimentation results as a report
